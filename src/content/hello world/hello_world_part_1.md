This tutorial is for developers to get started with development on the Secret Network. The local blockchain runs in a docker container and simulates the Intel SGX (TEE) that is a requirement for the Holodeck testnet and mainnet.

It's super easy and quick, once you have `docker` installed. Just a few commands!
